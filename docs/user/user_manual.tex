\section{Introduction}
This documentation is aimed at the user attempting to use the InfiniTag software. The prerequesites
for this documentation are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The Solr database has already been setup
    \item The back end has been installed with the requirements
    \item The front end has been setup and is running.
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip
\noindent
For instructions on getting the front and back ends set up, see the \href{https://github.com/AMOS-5/infinitag/blob/master/README.md}{README} in the repository.

\bigskip
\noindent
For help getting the Solr database up and running. See the various files in our \href{https://github.com/AMOS-5/infinitag/tree/master/docs/solr}{Solr documentation}.



\section{Document Overview / Start Page}
\label{docoverview}
Once the front end is up and running, navigate to the start page to see a table with a list of documents as seen in Figure \ref{fig:start_page}.

Notice in the top right corner is a status badge indicating the connection to the back end. If this is 'DOWN', then you will not be able to send or receive information from the server and will not be able to continue.

The search bar on this page enables you to filter documents by any criteria. Any word entered into the search box will be used to check for matching words in the name, tags, language, etc.

The + icon in the keywords column allows you to add any existing tag to a document.

Clicking on the edit button will enable the checkboxes to the right of the document name. By doing so you can apply one keyword to multiple documents.

\end{figure}

\section{Adding Documents}
Navigating to \verb|\documents| in the browser or clicking on the \verb|Add Documents| link in the menu will take the user to a form where they can select one or more documents to be uploaded. This can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:doc_upload}.

Upon selecting one or more documents all of the documents will be sent to the server for further processing. At the moment the documents will be stored in the database and the meta-information such as name, language, type, etc. will be extracted and stored along with the document content.

    \label{fig:doc_upload}
\end{figure}

\section{Maintaining Keywords}
Navigating to \verb|keywords| or clicking on the \verb|Keywords| link will take the user to a page where they can add dimensions and keywords to a keyword model as seen in Figure \ref{fig:key1}. These keywords are then available to be assigned to the documents on the start / document overview page.

Here one can add dimensions as well as keywords, which will enable the construction of hierarchical keyword models.

\section{Further Documentation}
Clicking on the \verb|Documentation| link will provide the user with three options as seen in Figure \ref{fig:doc_drop}:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item API Documentation. This provides the user with an overview of all API endpoints for the back end, along with the required parameters and expected return results. A partial example can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:apidoc}
    \item Front End Documentation. This is an external link which will show the user the actual code documentation for the front end.
    \item Back End Documentation. This is another external link which will show the code documentation for the server.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Utilities}
Important to notice is that the InfiniTag software comes with a utils folder. These are, in part, helper functions for the developers. However much more importantly are the scripts for categorizing and clustering documents. These scripts provide functionality for k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, LDA, and TF-IDF. These are experimental features which will be integrated into the core solution as soon as possible.
